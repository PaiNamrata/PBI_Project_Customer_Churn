 This project focuses on analyzing churn trends across factors like age, credit score, account balance,product type and statisfaction score.

 Key Features
✅ Dynamic Visualizations: Donut charts, Pie charts, line and stacked column charts, line charts, funnel and slicers to filter and explore data dynamically.
✅ Actionable Insights: 1.Identified the percentage for active vs inactive members and 
                        2. Percentage of credit card holders from churned customer
                        3. Count of Active Customers that are using the products 
                        4. To get a better understanding of age wise churned customer and their avg_statisfaction
                        5. To understand the relation between tenure , Balance and churn Rate.

📁 Data Preparation : 1. Total 10000 nos of records in .csv file
                      2. Using Power Query cleaned and tranformed data and created some calculate columns such as Member_status, CreditCard_status and Product_Type
                      
📈 Highlights
Region-Specific: Spain exhibits slightly higher churn than France and Germany.
Card Type : Members Having Gold Card Type have Higher churn than other card type members
Product Type : Product 3 and Product 4 needs to be a focused area as Most customers use either Product_1 or Product_2 .

Key Observations:
The age group around 35 shows the highest number of churned customers (244). However, average satisfaction scores improve slightly in older age brackets (up to 4.2), despite fewer churns.
Out of 10,000 total customers, 5,151 have churned, leading to a churn rate of 52%, which is quite high and may indicate underlying service or satisfaction issues.
51.51% of customers are inactive, whereas 48.49% are active. This suggests that a slight majority of the customer base is disengaged.
